The .py files in this folder are deprecated elements. these files originally sat in the anomaly detection folder when
running.
The internal directories would need to be changed to run correctly. all the files ran correctly at one point.
The move to the deprecated folder was to clean up but maintain an archive.
These files can run with a py 3.7.x or 3.6.10 interpreter, and require pytorch 1.4 and the pysyft compatible version 
(which is not specified here, because the version numbers were not tracked well during original development).
best to check openmined/pysyft github for install practices before running.
