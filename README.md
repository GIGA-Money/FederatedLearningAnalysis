# FederatedLearningAnalysis
This repo is the PyTorch implementation of Botnet Traffic Analysis. 
This Repository implements PySyft as a solution for federated learning implementations.  
## the works in this repo were the main implementation for the paper:

# This branch is used for the master to release.
these materials hold the lastest working version of the code with no depracated materials. further reading will attempt to produce a requirements 
config, and potentially a docker container. 
# however, there is no more development as of this latest commit, as the project has come to a close for the time.
